## Hi there 👋

📢 Nominate ([@nasrinpathan](https://github.com/nasrinpathan/)) as **[GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/nominate)**. If you appreciate her hard work and dedication to open source.

# 👋 Hi, I'm Nasrin

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Python enthusiast,Pyscript hacker and Founder.I have given my contribution to Buckaroo,Jupyter lab tab Extension and Pyscript.Worked on single link web development as the secured way of web development. I like working on my own projects.Three of my major projects are 'Scrape based prediction of actors' , 'Alexa can play word building' and 'Web development in Jupiter Notebook'. Scrape based prediction of actors is inspired from the project facial recognition application.Facial recoginition was just to predict faces. I wanted to automate the process from searching the actors names to downloading the images and predicting them.Alexa can play word building project was inspired from a toy which my son used to play.I couldn't find the unusual batteries for his toy but wrote a code for him to play.@Innovation for kids hackthon.Z&N team.Web Development in jupyter notebook happened because i wanted to try and end to end project.Having less knowledge on coding was trying my project on jupyter notebook and web Development in jupyter notebook happened.Current research is on VPN.Using VPN how you can make one country projects work in other country.How without changing your identity you can work in other countries.I was told to hire a person in India to get a job in UK.I belong to both the countries.With VPN my Indian projects work and without VPN my UK project are going to work.A person who worked for years in a place is scared of moving to a new place because your mobile locations define your experience and it's business for others if you move to a new place and you are going to be jobless in new place.It's seperating husband-wife relationship.Either one person has to sacrifice there profession to stay together or both of them are working in there respective locations to retain their job.If two identities are in same place one has to replace another.It's like a banner for other country folks to invite to you country.Talented folks are not getting jobs because folks with business influence are considered before talent.Currently working on Scrape based prediction of actors how can I make it work in UK using VPN.
